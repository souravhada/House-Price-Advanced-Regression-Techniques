# Advanced Regression for House Price Prediction

This project aims to predict house prices using advanced regression techniques.

## Introduction

In this project, we utilize advanced regression algorithms to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, location, etc. The predictive models are trained on a dataset containing information about different houses along with their corresponding sale prices.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques dataset available on Kaggle. It contains a wide range of features related to residential homes in Ames, Iowa, USA. The dataset consists of both numerical and categorical variables, making it suitable for regression analysis.

## Usage

To use this project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries (`pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, etc.).
3. Run the Jupyter notebook (`submission.ipynb`) to preprocess the data, train machine learning models, and generate predictions.
4. The predictions will be saved in a CSV file named `submission.csv`.

## Models

Several regression models are trained in this project, including:

- Random Forest Regressor
- AdaBoost Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor

These models are trained using the processed data to predict house prices.

## Submission

The predictions generated by the models are saved in a CSV file named `submission.csv`. This file can be submitted to the Kaggle competition or used for further analysis.
